This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Deals with Scientific notation in Plots 
options(scipen = 999)

# Useful functions  
library(tidyverse)

# Path Information 
path_dirty = "~/School_Work/F19/CPSD/Group_Proj/STA4102_Project/Data/AmesHousing.csv"
path_clean = "~/School_Work/F19/CPSD/Group_Proj/STA4102_Project/Data/cleaned_data.csv"
#Import Data
ames.dirty <- read.csv(path_dirty)

ames.clean <-read.csv(path_clean)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

```{r}
fig1 <- ggplot(data = ames.dirty) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = ames.dirty$SalePrice )) +
  ggtitle("Uncleaned")
fig2 <- ggplot(data = ames.clean) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = ames.clean$SalePrice)) + 
  ggtitle("Cleaned")
cowplot::plot_grid(fig1, fig2)
```

Now we will continue our analysis using only the clean version of the dataset.
First we will look for any outliers
```{r}
na_count <-sapply(ames.clean, function(y) sum(is.na(y)))
print("Sum of the NA values in each column: ")
na_count
```

From the above output we can see that some of our columns contain a lot of missing values. 
We have some missing values, namely: 

* Lot Frontage (Continuous): Linear feet of street connected to property
    + All of the porperty touching the street. 
* Alley (Nominal): Type of alley access to property
    +  Grvl	Gravel
    +  Pave	Paved
    +  NA 	No alley access


```{r}
# Store location of NA values for Lot.Frontage 
na_frontage <- is.na(ames.clean$Lot.Frontage)
ames.clean[na_frontage,]
```


Now we will look at the numeric columns specifically.
```{r}
# Grab all the numeric columns 

# Find the columns which are numeric 
numeric_cols <- sapply(ames.clean, is.numeric)

#Now store the numeric columns as its own list 
clean_numeric <- ames.clean[,numeric_cols]

# Print column names 
colnames(clean_numeric)
```
Description of the numeric columns: 

1. X - Need to drop useless index variable 
2. Order - Index variable of original dataset 
3. PID (Nominal): Parcel identification number  - can be used with city web site for parcel review. 
4. MS SubClass (Nominal): Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.	
5. Lot Frontage (Continuous): Linear feet of street connected to property
6. Lot Area (Continuous): Lot size in square feet
7. Overall Qual (Ordinal): Rates the overall material and finish of the house
8. Overall Cond (Ordinal): Rates the overall condition of the house
9. Year Built (Discrete): Original construction date
10. Year Remod/Add (Discrete): Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions)
11. Mas Vnr Area (Continuous): Masonry veneer area in square feet
12. BsmtFin SF 1 (Continuous): Type 1 finished square feet
13. BsmtFin SF 2 (Continuous): Type 2 finished square feet
14. Bsmt Unf SF (Continuous): Unfinished square feet of basement area
15. Total Bsmt SF (Continuous): Total square feet of basement area
16. 1st flr sf (continuous): first floor square feet
17. 2nd Flr SF (Continuous)	: Second floor square feet
18. Low Qual Fin SF (Continuous): Low quality finished square feet (all floors)
19. Gr Liv Area (Continuous): Above grade (ground) living area square feet
20.
21. Bsmt Half Bath (Discrete): Basement half bathrooms
22. Full Bath (Discrete): Full bathrooms above grade
23. Half Bath (Discrete): Half baths above grade
24. Bedroom (Discrete): Bedrooms above grade (does NOT include basement bedrooms)
25. Kitchen (Discrete): Kitchens above grade
26. TotRmsAbvGrd	(Discrete): Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)
27. Fireplaces (Discrete): Number of fireplaces
28. Garage Yr Blt (Discrete): Year garage was built
29. Garage Cars (Discrete): Size of garage in car capacity
30. Garage Area (Continuous): Size of garage in square feet
31. Wood Deck SF (Continuous): Wood deck area in square feet
32. Open Porch SF (Continuous): Open porch area in square feet
33. Enclosed Porch (Continuous): Enclosed porch area in square feet
34. 3-Ssn Porch (Continuous): Three season porch area in square feet
35. Screen Porch (Continuous): Screen porch area in square feet
36. Pool Area (Continuous): Pool area in square feet
37. Misc Val (Continuous): $Value of miscellaneous feature
38. Mo Sold (Discrete): Month Sold (MM)
39. Yr Sold (Discrete): Year Sold (YYYY)
40. SalePrice (Continuous): Sale price 
 




```{r}
# Lets fit a linear regression to all the numeric columns 
Regression <- lm(SalePrice ~., data=clean_numeric)
summary(Regression)
```
```{r}
qqnorm(rstandard(Regression))
qqline(rstandard(Regression))

s.text <- shapiro.test(residuals(Regression))
print(s.text)
```
We need to drop some irrelevant columns, lets first copy our data frame. 
```{r}
# Copy clean data frame 
copy_numeric <- data.frame(clean_numeric)

# Check to see if we properly copied 
#racemem(copy_numeric)==tracemem(clean_numeric)
# the above should return false 

# Drop "X" and "Order" as they are meaningless
copy_numeric <-select(copy_numeric, -one_of(c("X","Order")))

copy_numeric
```

Now we will fit the full linear model 
```{r}
Regression2 <- lm(SalePrice ~., data=copy_numeric)
summary(Regression)
```

```{r}
alias(Regression2)
```
From this output we can see that 

1. BsmtFin.SF.1
2. BsmtFin.SF.2
3. Bsmt.Unf.SF

are linearly dependent on Total.Bsmt.SF and 

1. X1st.Flr.SF
2. X2nd.Flr.SF
3. Low.Qual.Fin.SF

are linearly dependent on Gr.Liv.Area
```{r}
# Lets make a heatmap of the correlations 
heat_vals <- c("SalePrice", "Total.Bsmt.SF", "BsmtFin.SF.1", "BsmtFin.SF.2",
               "Bsmt.Unf.SF", "Gr.Liv.Area", "X1st.Flr.SF", "X2nd.Flr.SF",
               "Low.Qual.Fin.SF")

my_cor_vals <- select(copy_numeric, heat_vals)
cormat <- round(cor(my_cor_vals),2)
melted_cormat <- melt(cormat)
melted_cormat

# Plot heatmap 
ggplot(data=melted_cormat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white")+
 scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "white", 
   midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab", 
   name="Pearson\nCorrelation") +
  theme_minimal()+ 
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, 
    size = 12, hjust = 1))+
 coord_fixed()
```
